Internationalization
--------------------

Internationalization is the process of developing a plugin so it can easily be translated into other languages. Internationalization is often abbreviated as `i18n` (because there are 18 letters between the letters i and n).

WordPress is used all over the world, in countries where English is not the main language. The strings in the WordPress plugins need to be coded in a special way so that can be easily translated into other languages. As a developer, you may not be able to provide _localizations_ (meaning, changes required to the text and other things like number formats specific to a given _locale_ (location))for all your users; however, a translator can successfully localize the theme without needing to modify the source code itself.
