The Plugin Developer Handbook is a resource for all things WordPress plugins. Whether you’re new to WordPress plugin development, or you’re an experienced plugin developer, you should be able to find the answer to many of your plugin-related questions right here.

*   If you’re new to plugin development, start by reading the [introduction](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/intro/) and then move on to [the basics](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/).
*   The info in [plugin security](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/security/) will introduce best practices for security related stuff.
*   [Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/hooks/) are what make your plugin interact with WordPress, and how you can let other developers interact with your plugin.
*   [Privacy](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/privacy/) will help you understand about handling sensitive data.
*   To find out more about WordPress’ built-in functionality that you can use in your plugin, check out [Administration Menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/administration-menus/), [Shortcodes](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/shortcodes/), [Settings](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/settings/), [Metadata](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/metadata/), [Custom Post Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/), [Taxonomies](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomies/), and [Users](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/users/).

*   To learn about time-based WordPress tasks, check out the [Cron](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/cron/) chapter.
*   [Internationalization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/internationalization/) is how you get your plugin ready for use in locales other than your own.
*   When all that is done, you can prepare your plugin for inclusion in the [Plugin Directory](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugin/wordpress-org/)
